 <li style="font-size: 22px;">Udayrampur Pallishree Shikshayatan
south 24 Pargana District Bishnupur  
    One of the notable promising educational
    institutions under the police station. 
    This educational institution is the pride 
   of the people of this region.  Since 1947, 
   this glorious institution has given birth to many children. 
    If you make a list of how many doctors, engineers, lawyers,
    professors, teachers and successful politicians have created this school,
    it will become a 'calendar'.</li> <br>
    <li style="font-size: 22px;"> However, the current situation is different. 
        We are going through a turbulent time that
         it is a challenge to teach and manage students properly. 
        Yet teachers are committed to their duties. 
         Parikar and the management committee are also determined
        to maintain the overall discipline of the school. </li>
        <li style="font-size: 22px;"> We, the parents,the locals,
            the educationists and the well-wishers 
            are cordially inviting you to complete the school education
            system properly without any help. 
             Help the organization move forward. 
              Your well-thought-out opinion and constructive
            advice will be our path. 
        </li>
           <li style="font-size: 22px;">In this "diary",
                respect certain rules with dignity,
                 keep students informed and help maintain
                  overall discipline - we hope this request
                   from all of us will become Pallisri -
                    truly Arai Shri in our joint efforts.
           </li>
